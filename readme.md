# Geoff the bot

Geoff is a discord bot built to play small trivia quizzes in channels.
When he hears someone say **!quiz**, he will start asking questions and keeping track of scores and answers.
The questions are fetched from [opentdb.com](https://opentdb.com/).

Geoff has another habit. Whenever someone writes **!chuck**, he will figure out his best Chuck Norris joke and tell everyone in the channel
(The jokes are actually fetched from [The internet Chuck Norris Database](http://www.icndb.com/)).
